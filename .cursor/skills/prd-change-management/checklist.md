# PRD Change Management Checklist

Use for a systematic pass when analyzing and integrating PRD changes mid-development.

## Before analysis
- [ ] Original PRD read (e.g. PRD.md, prd.md)
- [ ] Current dev context known (features.md, RFCs/, done vs in progress)
- [ ] Proposed changes clearly stated or attached
- [ ] Missing critical info: specific questions asked before proceeding

## During analysis
- [ ] Each change classified (category, size, must-have vs nice-to-have)
- [ ] Impact assessed per change (features, RFCs, timeline, dependencies, completed/in-progress work)
- [ ] Implementation strategy chosen per change (now / schedule / phase / defer)
- [ ] Documentation updates specified (PRD sections, user stories, acceptance criteria, timeline)
- [ ] Communication plan and risk assessment completed

## Recommendations
- [ ] Per-change decision and 3–5 concrete steps
- [ ] Owner or trigger stated for next steps
- [ ] Updated PRD content saved if requested (e.g. prd-updated.md)
